### Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling

- The analysis involved working with a CSV file that contains data on 5000 customers. We used the Pandas read_csv function to read this data into our analysis environment.
- Throughout the project, we performed an in-depth analysis of the data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to gain insights into the relationships between various features and the target variable (loan application). This allowed us to identify key patterns and trends within the dataset.
